This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

mydata = read.csv("example_data.csv")
plot(mydata$xdata,mydata$ydata)
# some guesses for the parameters.
p1 = 1
p2 = 0.2

# do the fit
fit = nls(ydata ~ p1*cos(p2*xdata) + p2*sin(p1*xdata), data = mydata, start = list(p1=p1,p2=p2))

#Plot the fitted line
new = data.frame(xdata = seq(min(mydata$xdata),max(mydata$xdata),len=200))
lines(new$xdata,predict(fit,newdata=new))
